## :star2: About the Project

The Todo application is a full-stack web application built using the React framework. It features "CRUD" functionality, which allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. The app provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily manage their tasks.

The application allows users to create a new task by entering a description and selecting a due date. Once a task is created, it can be marked as completed, edited, or deleted. Users can also view a list of all tasks and filter tasks by their completion status.

The Todo application is built using React, a popular front-end JavaScript framework, and utilizes a back-end database to store tasks. It is designed to be scalable and can be easily modified to add additional features.

The app is a useful tool for anyone who needs to manage their tasks, such as students, professionals, or anyone looking to stay organized. It is a versatile and flexible application that can be customized to fit the needs of any user.
